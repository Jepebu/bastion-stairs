# bastion-stairs
A stupid lil program to play a stupid lil minigame in Overwatch :) 								
This just plays the minigame "Bastion stairs" in Overwatch 2 using some OpenCV to image match.								
I've tried other methods but the 7 layer method seems to work as the best trade off between speed and accuracy.
